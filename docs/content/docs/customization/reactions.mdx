# Reactions

Everyone's read your amazing blog and they want to give you a pat on the back!

They can do this by using the reactions feature built-into Vortex!

Let's see how to use it.

## Usage

```jsx
// if needed, custom components can be used instead of emojis for reaction icons
// we can return a JSX Element from this Emote component
function Emote(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <img
      style = {{ width: "28px" }}
      src = "https://discord.com/assets/08c0a077780263f3df97613e58e71744.svg"
      // you can display the closest emoji to your custom emote if there's an issue with rendering your custom emote
      alt = "👍"
    />
  );
}


<Blog
    reactions = {
        // name stands for the name of the reaction specified in the `reactions` list
        // upvoted is whether or not the reaction is being upvoted or un-upvoted
        onClick: (name: string, upvoted: boolean) => {
            return console.log(name, upvoted); // logs the name of the reaction and whether it's being upvoted or un-upvoted
            // eg: 'heart', true
        },
        // reactions represents a list of reactions that you would like to have for your blog
        reactions: [
            {
                // `name` stands for the name of the reaction (this will be what you recieve on the `onClick` invocation)
                name: 'heart',
                // `upvotes` stands for the number of upvotes for this reaction
                upvotes: 10,
                // `upvoted` stands for whether or not the reaction is already upvoted (useful if you're loading values from a database)
                upvoted: true,
                // `emote` is the icon that will be displayed for this reaction (see further below for custom emote support)
                // an emote can be a string or a React component (for custom emotes / icons)
                emote: '❤️',
            },
            {
                // `name` stands for the name of the reaction (this will be what you recieve on the `onClick` invocation)
                name: 'thumbs-up',
                // `upvotes` stands for the number of upvotes for this reaction
                upvotes: 5,
                // `upvoted` stands for whether or not the reaction is already upvoted (useful if you're loading values from a database)
                upvoted: false,
                // `emote` is the icon that will be displayed for this reaction.
                // a react component can be passed in if you want to use a custom emote
                emote: ThumbsUp(),
            },
        ],
    }
/>
```
