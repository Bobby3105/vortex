# Getting started

Welcome to the Vortex documentation!

Vortex allows you to create beautiful, customizable, and modern blogs within seconds!

### Installation

Inside your React project directory, install Vortex by running either of the following:

```bash
npm i @dimensionhq/vortex
# or
yarn add @dimensionhq/vortex
# or
pnpm i @dimensionhq/vortex
```

### Usage

Now that we've installed Vortex, let's import it.

We can do so by importing the `Blog` component directly from the Vortex library and its respective stylesheet.

```jsx
import "@dimensionhq/vortex/dist/style.css";
import Blog from "@dimensionhq/vortex";
```
