# Layout

Vortex supports a variety of in-built layouts for your blog.

## Usage

Changing the layout of your blog is as simple as changing the `layout` prop.

```jsx
<Blog
    // layout is specified using the `layout` prop
    // this value can be one of the following:
    // Default - This is the default Vortex layout. It is heavily inspired by the Discord blog layout.
    // DevTO - This is similar to the layout used by Dev.to.
    // Hashnode - This is similar to the layout used by Hashnode.
    layout = "Default"
    ...
/>
```

### Layout Props

| Attribute  | Optional | Accepted Values              | Default |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| **layout** | `false`  | `Default / Hashnode / DevTO` | `null`  |
